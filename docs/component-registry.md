## Registry

| ID | Name | Type | Domain | Status | Summary | Docs |
|----|------|------|--------|--------|---------|------|
| `context-mode-hooks` | context-mode Enforcement Hook Scripts | component-pack | developer-tooling | active | Blocking PreToolUse hook scripts (`.mjs`, Node-only since v0.2.0 — no `jq`, no Unix-shell requirement) that enforce context-mode routing rules by intercepting Grep, Bash (pattern-matched), and WebFetch tool calls. | [purpose](../src/context-mode-hooks/docs/purpose.md) |
| `setup-hook-integration` | Setup Hook Integration | component-pack | developer-tooling | active | setup.sh/ps1, skill-sync, and hook adapters (copilot, cursor, windsurf, codex) — installs and configures enforcement hooks, telemetry hooks, context-mode hooks, commit standards, and external skill management into any Planifest-managed project. Now also writes a `.planifest-setup-flags` marker recording the flags used at install time (v0.4.0, 0000020). | [purpose](../src/setup-hook-integration/docs/purpose.md) |
| `planifest-framework` | Planifest Framework | component-pack | developer-tooling | active | Core standards, skills, hooks, and setup scripts enforcing the confirmed-design pipeline (v0.25.0: ship-agent PR output omits the AI-attribution footer by default and its P7 archive commit stages `plan/current/` explicitly; setup scripts additionally track active flags/backend-url in a versioned `planifest-overrides/setup-config/{tool}.md`; docs-agent routes `recommendations.md` deferred items/tech debt into `plan/backlog/` going forward and its Gate B (plus other phase-skill gates, audited) respects `continuous_run`; the Scope Lock Challenge defaults to always-drafted, batch-presented answers, superseding 0000017-ADR-003; subagent parallelism directives expanded for validate-agent, docs-agent, and agent-dispatch-standards.md). | [component.yml](../planifest-framework/component.yml) |

## Notes

- This registry is updated by the docs-agent at the end of each feature pipeline.
- Each `ID` corresponds to a directory under `src/` containing a `component.yml` manifest.
- Add new components here when a new feature pipeline completes Phase 6.
