title: "Backlog Entry: 0000060 - P7 cross-reference check cannot detect the link breakage it exists to prevent"
summary: "The ship-agent's pre-archive cross-reference check searches for the literal string plan/current/ in files outside the archive. The archive move re-parents every file one directory deeper, breaking relative links inside the moved folder — which the check never examines. A downstream archive shipped with ten dead links while the check reported success."

## Problem

`skills/planifest-ship-agent/SKILL.md:39` defines the pre-archive check:

> *"**Cross-reference check (run first, before Step 1):** Before writing the changelog, search the repo for links pointing at `plan/current/...` — `docs/*.md` (especially `docs/decisions-index.md`'s ADR links), `src/*/docs/*.md`, and any other living doc. Update every found reference to the post-archive path… A moved folder with stale incoming links silently breaks navigation for the next reader."*

Two properties make it unable to detect the common case:

1. **It matches a string, not a link.** It looks for the literal text `plan/current/`. A relative link such as `../../.claude/skills/x/SKILL.md` or `../backlog/y/entry.md` contains no such string and is invisible to it.
2. **It searches the wrong side.** It scans *incoming* references from `docs/`, `src/*/docs/` and other living docs — files that do not move. It never examines links *inside* `plan/current/`, which is the folder being re-parented.

Step 6.3 recursively copies `plan/current/` to `plan/_archive/{feature-id}-{date}/`, pushing every file one directory deeper — and two deeper for anything in a subdirectory such as `requirements/`. Every relative link pointing outside the folder is invalidated by exactly that shift. Those are the links the check cannot see.

**Observed impact.** Feature `0000001-prototype-folder-selection` in the downstream repo `rapid-prototypes` passed this check at P7 and shipped its archive with **ten broken relative links**:

| Broken form | Files | Correct after the move |
|---|---|---|
| `../../.claude/skills/…/SKILL.md` | `domain-glossary.md`, `execution-plan.md`, `scope.md`, `risk-register.md`, `iteration-log.md` | `../../../.claude/skills/…` |
| `../../../.claude/skills/…/SKILL.md` | `requirements/req-001…`, `req-002…`, `req-003…` | `../../../../.claude/skills/…` (one deeper again) |
| `../backlog/…/entry.md` | `recommendations.md` (×3) | `../../backlog/…` |

Every one was correct when written and broken by the move. None was reported. They were found by accident a feature later, while specifying an unrelated requirement.

**This is not caused by unusual downstream usage — though the precise link forms above were the downstream author's.** To be exact: the `../../.claude/skills/…` paths in that archive were written by the downstream orchestrator, not copied verbatim from a template. What the framework's own templates emit is the same *shape* of link and it is broken too:

`templates/requirement.template.md:9`, and likewise `execution-plan.template.md` and `iteration-log.template.md`:

```markdown
**Skill:** [spec-agent](../skills/planifest-spec-agent/SKILL.md)
```

From `plan/current/requirements/req-001.md` that resolves to `plan/skills/…`; from the archived `plan/_archive/{feature}-{date}/requirements/req-001.md` it resolves to `plan/_archive/{feature}-{date}/skills/…`. **Neither exists.** The template link is wrong in both locations, before archiving and after.

So the universality claim holds by a stronger route than originally stated: every project that instantiates these templates emits relative `**Skill:**` back-references that do not resolve, and the archive move changes only *how* wrong they are. The cross-reference check sees none of it in either case, because none of these links contains the string `plan/current/`.

Two distinct defects are therefore in scope, and the second may be the easier win:

- the check cannot detect relative-link breakage (this entry), and
- the templates emit relative `**Skill:**` links that never resolve from where the file actually lives.

**Worse than an ordinary bug:** the check exists specifically to prevent this, so it passing is read as assurance that navigation survived. Silence from a check that cannot fail is indistinguishable from a clean result.

## Suggested Action

Replace the string search with link resolution, run against the archive destination:

1. After the copy in Step 6.3 — or against simulated destination paths before it — walk every `.md` file in the new archive directory.
2. Extract each relative link, resolve it against the filesystem from its *post-move* location.
3. Repair the depth, or fail loudly, on anything that does not resolve.

Roughly fifteen lines of Node, and it converts a check that cannot detect the failure into one that cannot miss it. Keep the existing incoming-reference sweep as well — it catches a real, different case.

**Evidence the fix works.** The downstream repo ran precisely this at the *next* feature's P7 and it immediately caught a live break — a `../backlog/…` link in that run's own `recommendations.md` that would have re-parented to `plan/_archive/backlog/…`. Corrected before the move; that archive shipped with zero broken links, against ten for the feature before it.

Consider applying the walk repository-wide rather than only to the archive. The same downstream check surfaced `plan/feature-structure.md → ../templates/`, a pre-existing break in framework-shipped scaffolding unrelated to archiving, which the same routine would catch.

## Why Deferred

Filed from a downstream repo that does not maintain this framework. The fix belongs to `skills/planifest-ship-agent/SKILL.md` and possibly a small companion script under `scripts/`, neither of which the filing project modifies.

The downstream project is not blocked — it repaired its ten links by hand and now runs the resolution check manually at P7. But it will recur at every archive, in every project, until this is fixed here.
