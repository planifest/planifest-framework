# Quirks — setup-hook-integration

## Q-001 — context-mode `block-bash.sh` hook fires on git commit messages containing URLs

The context-mode blocking hook intercepts Bash commands containing URL patterns. When `git commit -m "..."` includes an `https://` URL in the message body, the hook blocks the command. Workaround: keep URLs out of commit message bodies, or use multi-line commits via a heredoc that separates the subject (URL-free) from the body.

## Q-002 — `jq` not available on Windows; node used as fallback

`setup.sh` originally used `jq` for `settings.json` manipulation. `jq` is not installed by default on Windows. All JSON operations use `node -e` with BOM-stripping (`.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')`). This means `node` ≥18 is a hard runtime requirement.

## Q-003 — commit-msg advisory hook subject line length uses byte count, not char count

`${#SUBJECT}` in bash counts bytes, not Unicode characters. For commit messages with non-ASCII characters (e.g., em-dash `—`), the reported length may exceed the actual visible character count. The `—` in `feat(0000003): Phase 3 — commit standards` registers as 3 bytes, causing false advisory triggers when the visual length is under 72 chars. Known but low-impact — advisory hook exits 0.

## Q-004 — `skill-sync.sh sync` produces "No manifest found" on first run

Before any external skills are added, `external-skills.json` does not exist. `cmd_sync` logs "No manifest found — nothing to sync." This is expected and non-fatal (calls use `|| true`), but may appear as noise in setup output.

## Q-005 — Windows `mktemp` paths not recognized as git repos

`mktemp -d` on Windows/Git Bash creates directories under a path that git treats as having "dubious ownership". `git init` in these directories succeeds but subsequent `git config` calls fail with exit 128. This affects the telemetry integration tests (see TD-004).

## Q-006: `Write-SetupFlagsMarker` (0000020) verified statically only, no pwsh in this dev environment

The `.claude/.planifest-setup-flags` marker write added to `setup.ps1` (REQ-008) could not be exercised by a live invocation during this feature's codegen pass because no PowerShell runtime (`pwsh`) is available in this session's environment. `bash`/`setup.sh`'s equivalent logic was verified with live temp-workspace runs (see `tests/test-0000020-req-008-install-time-marker-write.sh`, parts a-d); the `setup.ps1` side (part e) is checked statically (function exists, calls the marker writer, uses the matching field names). Recommend a live `pwsh` run of `test_setup.ps1` plus a manual `.\planifest-framework\setup.ps1 claude-code` invocation on Windows or a pwsh-enabled CI runner before this feature ships, to catch anything the static check cannot (e.g. a `ConvertTo-Json` depth or encoding mismatch).

## Q-008: `cline.ps1`'s boot-file relocation (0000027-req-002) verified statically only, no pwsh in this dev environment

Same constraint as Q-006. `cline.ps1`'s `BootFile` was relocated from `.clinerules` to `.clinerules\00-planifest-boot.md` to fix the boot-file/skills-dir path collision (mirroring `cline.sh`'s fix, which was verified live via a new regression test on a disposable workspace). No PowerShell runtime available in this session's environment to exercise `cline.ps1` live — verified via structural source assertions (exact `BootFile`/`SkillsDir` string values) in `tests/test-0000027-req-002-cline-path-collision.sh`, part (e). Recommend a live `pwsh` run before this feature ships, same recommendation as Q-006.

## Q-009: hooks are installed as copies, so a shared module exists at runtime only if a glob copies it (0000028)

Installed hooks are plain `cp` copies, never symlinks, so an `import` in a hook resolves against `.claude/hooks/`, not against `planifest-framework/hooks/`. A shared module is therefore present at runtime only because some `setup.sh` code path actually copied it. `install_tier1_hooks()` copied telemetry with the narrow glob `emit-phase-*.mjs`, which would have installed the callers and dropped every shared module they import, on Cursor, Windsurf and Cline. It is now `*.mjs`, matching the two non-tier-1 install functions and `setup.ps1`'s `Install-Tier1Hooks`. The failure this would have caused is not graceful: an ESM import of an absent module throws at module-load time, before the hook's own `try/catch`, so the hook exits non-zero rather than exiting 0 as NFR-001 requires.

Copying is also additive only. `setup.sh` never prunes, so a module renamed or deleted upstream leaves a stale copy behind. There are currently no orphans, but a `*.mjs` glob makes this worth watching in a way an implicit allowlist did not.

## Q-010: `setup.sh` wrote enforcement hook commands as bare `.mjs` paths and they never ran (fixed 0000028)

For as long as the enforcement block has existed, `setup.sh` pushed commands such as `.claude/hooks/enforcement/gate-write.mjs` into `settings.json` with no interpreter prefix, while the hook sources are committed with mode `100644` and `cp` propagates that mode. The shell could not execute the wired command and returned 126. Claude Code treats any exit other than 2 as non-blocking, so seven enforcement hooks silently did not run: the write gate, both telemetry backstops, all three `UserPromptSubmit` orchestrator checks, and 0000028's own em dash guard. Only `ratchet-check.mjs` worked, and only because its source file happens to carry mode `100755`.

`setup.ps1` had always written `node $HooksDir/gate-write.mjs`, so the two scripts disagreed and the PowerShell form was the correct one. Fixed at 0000028 P5 by prefixing every enforcement command string with `node`, which is also the only portable form since Windows has no exec bit. Worth remembering when reading test evidence: the P4 suite invoked the hook as `node em-dash-guard.mjs` and passed, because it tested the hook rather than the command string `setup.sh` actually writes.

## Q-007: OpenCode's `setup.ps1` tool config does not return a `SkillsDir`-bearing object (pre-existing)

`setup/opencode.ps1` performs its install as a sequence of top-level statements rather than returning a config object like every other `setup/<tool>.ps1`, so `Invoke-PlanifestSetup`'s `$toolConfig.SkillsDir` is empty for OpenCode on Windows. This predates 0000020 and is out of scope for this feature per `plan/current/scope.md` (general `setup.ps1` parity drift), but it means the new `Write-SetupFlagsMarker` call is guarded to skip silently for OpenCode on Windows rather than error. OpenCode's marker write works correctly on the `setup.sh` side (bespoke branch in `run_tool_setup`, see ADR-002 implementation notes).
