### Local Git Only
Don't fetch, pull, push or otherwise attempt to use remote git commands. In some cases, you don't have the passphrase so you will always fail on these commands. Instead commit changes to a local feature branch. The human on the loop can confirm that it's up to date at the start of a plan. The human on the loop will push your code and create any pull requests on your behalf. Don't use git worktrees - ensure you are on a feat/ branch but work directly in the working directory.

The exception to the rule is that you can operate with git and GitHub commands if the human expressly asks you to. Report back if unsuccessful for any reason in these exceptional cases.

### Commit Granularly, Continuously
Commit locally after every meaningful artifact write — do not batch changes waiting for a phase gate, an approval checkpoint, or task completion. A single requirement doc, ADR, TDD cycle, or config fix is a commit on its own; don't hold it pending a bigger, later commit. Uncommitted work in the working directory is unrecoverable progress — commit early and often so nothing sits unsaved.
